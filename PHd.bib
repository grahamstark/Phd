We describe the generic algorithm and discuss and extension by which reasons for any change in the marginal effective tax rate may be explained. We derive continuous expressions for average tax rate (ATR), average marginal tax rate (AMTR), replacement rate (RR) and marginal effective tax rate (METR) schedules, expressed solely in terms of the marginal wage rate and 'virtual' income. A practical application serves to highlight the usefulness of this algorithm in fiscal policy analysis at micro level.},

	abstract = {We introduce JAS-mine, a new Java-based computational platform that features tools to support
the development of large-scale, data-driven, discrete-event simulations. JAS-mine is specifically designed
for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches.
An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications
and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework.
The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of
the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design.
For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code,
making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete
parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for
uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.},

Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

	title = {A {Stata} program for calibration weighting},
	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/usug10/02.html},
	abstract = {Although survey data are sometimes weighted by their selection weights, it is often preferable to use auxiliary information available on the whole population to improve estimation. Calibration weighting (Deville and Sarndal, 1992, Journal of the American Statistical Association 87: 376-382) is one of the most common methods of doing this. This method adjusts the selection weights so that known population totals for the auxiliary variables are reproduced exactly, while ensuring that the calibrated weights are as close as possible to the original sampling weight. The simplest example of calibration is poststratification. This is the special case where the auxiliary variable is a single categorical variable. General calibration extends this to deal with more than one auxiliary variable and allows the user to include both categorical and numerical variables. A typical example might occur in a population survey, where the selection weights could be calibrated to ensure that the sample weighted by the calibration weights has exactly the same distribution as the population on variables such as age, sex, and region. Many packages have routines for calibration. SAS has the macro CALMAR; GenStat has the procedure SVCALIBRATE; and R has the function calibrate. However, no such routine is publicly available in Stata. I will introduce a user-written Stata program for calibration and will also discuss a simple extension to show how it can incorporate a nonresponse correction. I will also briefly discuss the program's strengths and limitations when compared to rival packages.},

	abstract = {Take-up of a social benefit is usually defined as receiving a benefit for which an individual or household is eligible. The take-up rate is the fraction of those eligible for a program who participate and receive a benefit or service. We survey estimates of take-up of social benefits around the world, discuss alternative theories of reasons for incomplete take-up, and survey the empirical evidence on the importance of different factors. We find a wide range of take-up rates around the world which follow some general patterns but are not easily explained. Theories of incomplete take-up include those involving low monetary or utility gains, stigma of receipt, monetary and nonmonetary costs of program participation, imperfect information, administrative barriers, and mismeasurement. The types of individuals who do and do not take up a program is argued to be determined by the joint distribution of gains and losses across those types, which ones face the largest administrative burden of participation and largest information deficits, and face more program operator error. There is a large body of evidence showing the importance of benefit gain and earnings losses from take-up but a smaller body of evidence on other factors, which shows that administrative barriers and costs, lack of information, and stigma all appear to be important for different programs. While there are no easy solutions to the problem of incomplete take-up, policies to at least lessen the problem are argued to be available, although generally not without increased government expenditure.},

	abstract = {Political scientists have increasingly deployed conjoint survey experiments to understand multidimensional choices in various settings. In this paper, we show that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) constitutes an aggregation of individual-level preferences that is meaningful both theoretically and empirically. First, extending previous results to allow for arbitrary randomization distributions, we show how the AMCE represents a summary of voters’ multidimensional preferences that combines directionality and intensity according to a probabilistic generalization of the Borda rule. We demonstrate why incorporating both the directionality and intensity of multi-attribute preferences is essential for analyzing real-world elections, in which ceteris paribus comparisons almost never occur. Second, and in further empirical support of this point, we show how this aggregation translates directly into a primary quantity of interest to election scholars: the effect of a change in an attribute on a candidate’s or party’s expected vote share. These properties hold irrespective of the heterogeneity, strength, or interactivity of voters’ preferences and regardless of how votes are aggregated into seats. Finally, we propose, formalize, and evaluate the feasibility of using conjoint data to estimate alternative quantities of interest to electoral studies, including the effect of an attribute on the probability of winning.},

Some research suggests that citizens are fiscally conservative, while other research shows that they punish governments for implementing fiscal consolidation. This begs the question of whether and how much citizens care about debt. We argue that debt is not a priority for citizens because reducing it involves spending and tax trade-offs. Using a split-sample experiment and a conjoint experiment in four European countries, we show that fiscal consolidation at the cost of spending cuts or taxes hikes is less popular than commonly assumed. Revenue-based consolidation is especially unpopular, but expenditure-based consolidation is also contested. Moreover, the public has clear fiscal policy priorities: People do not favour lower debt and taxes, but they support higher progressive taxes to pay for more government spending. The article furthers our understanding of public opinion on fiscal policies and the likely political consequences of austerity.},

We conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 800 UK-resident adults. We presented them with welfare schemes that varied generosity; in their fiscal implications (rates of personal income tax as well as other funding mechanisms); in their population consequences (effects on the rate of poverty, on inequality, and on physical and mental health); and in their institutional design features (means testing, conditionality, and universality). The strongest driver of preference for a welfare scheme was its effect on poverty: people liked schemes that reduced poverty, and disliked schemes that increased it. Respondents were prepared to trade off their dispreference for higher personal income taxes against poverty: even for Conservative voters, substantial income tax rises were acceptable in exchange for sufficiently large reductions in the poverty rate. Taxes on wealth and carbon emissions were positively valued relative to increasing government borrowing. Respondents paid some attention to the effects of schemes on inequality and physical and mental health as well as poverty. Preferences over institutional design features, such as means testing, conditionality and universality, were weak. We discuss the findings with respect to the envelope of welfare systems that would be politically feasible in the UK context.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the options available to researchers analysing multilevel (including longitudinal) data, with the aim of supporting good methodological decision-making. Given the confusion in the literature about the key properties of fixed and random effects (FE and RE) models, we present these models’ capabilities and limitations. We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},
