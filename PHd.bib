We describe the generic algorithm and discuss and extension by which reasons for any change in the marginal effective tax rate may be explained. We derive continuous expressions for average tax rate (ATR), average marginal tax rate (AMTR), replacement rate (RR) and marginal effective tax rate (METR) schedules, expressed solely in terms of the marginal wage rate and 'virtual' income. A practical application serves to highlight the usefulness of this algorithm in fiscal policy analysis at micro level.},

	abstract = {We introduce JAS-mine, a new Java-based computational platform that features tools to support
the development of large-scale, data-driven, discrete-event simulations. JAS-mine is specifically designed
for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches.
An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications
and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework.
The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of
the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design.
For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code,
making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete
parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for
uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.},

Using income tax record data in combination with survey data is a potential approach to address the problem; we consider here the UK’s pioneering ‘SPI adjustment’ method that implements this idea. Since 1992, the principal income distribution series (reported annually in Households Below Average Income) has been based on household survey data in which the incomes of a small number of ‘very rich’ individuals are adjusted using information from ‘very rich’ individuals in personal income tax return data. We explain what the procedure involves, reveal the extent to which it addresses survey under-coverage of top incomes, and show how it affects estimates of overall income inequality. More generally, we assess whether the SPI adjustment is fit for purpose and consider whether variants of it could be employed by other countries.},

	title = {A {Stata} program for calibration weighting},
	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/boc/usug10/02.html},
	abstract = {Although survey data are sometimes weighted by their selection weights, it is often preferable to use auxiliary information available on the whole population to improve estimation. Calibration weighting (Deville and Sarndal, 1992, Journal of the American Statistical Association 87: 376-382) is one of the most common methods of doing this. This method adjusts the selection weights so that known population totals for the auxiliary variables are reproduced exactly, while ensuring that the calibrated weights are as close as possible to the original sampling weight. The simplest example of calibration is poststratification. This is the special case where the auxiliary variable is a single categorical variable. General calibration extends this to deal with more than one auxiliary variable and allows the user to include both categorical and numerical variables. A typical example might occur in a population survey, where the selection weights could be calibrated to ensure that the sample weighted by the calibration weights has exactly the same distribution as the population on variables such as age, sex, and region. Many packages have routines for calibration. SAS has the macro CALMAR; GenStat has the procedure SVCALIBRATE; and R has the function calibrate. However, no such routine is publicly available in Stata. I will introduce a user-written Stata program for calibration and will also discuss a simple extension to show how it can incorporate a nonresponse correction. I will also briefly discuss the program's strengths and limitations when compared to rival packages.},

	abstract = {Take-up of a social benefit is usually defined as receiving a benefit for which an individual or household is eligible. The take-up rate is the fraction of those eligible for a program who participate and receive a benefit or service. We survey estimates of take-up of social benefits around the world, discuss alternative theories of reasons for incomplete take-up, and survey the empirical evidence on the importance of different factors. We find a wide range of take-up rates around the world which follow some general patterns but are not easily explained. Theories of incomplete take-up include those involving low monetary or utility gains, stigma of receipt, monetary and nonmonetary costs of program participation, imperfect information, administrative barriers, and mismeasurement. The types of individuals who do and do not take up a program is argued to be determined by the joint distribution of gains and losses across those types, which ones face the largest administrative burden of participation and largest information deficits, and face more program operator error. There is a large body of evidence showing the importance of benefit gain and earnings losses from take-up but a smaller body of evidence on other factors, which shows that administrative barriers and costs, lack of information, and stigma all appear to be important for different programs. While there are no easy solutions to the problem of incomplete take-up, policies to at least lessen the problem are argued to be available, although generally not without increased government expenditure.},
