      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>My PhD thesis builds on decades of academic research conducted as
  Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the
  Open University and as Director of Virtual Worlds. I present three
  publications developed in my role as Senior Research Policy at
  Northumbria which emerges from this work. I am a leading specialist in
  microsimulation modelling of tax-benefit systems, programming
  software, databases and interfaces. Most significantly, I am the
  creator of TAXBEN (Johnson, Webb &amp; Stark 1990), the IFS’ tax and
  benefit microsimulation model (Giles &amp; McCrae 1995), which
  continues to be used to analyse Government tax-benefit reform.</p>
      <p>Having started my career in Economics at Lancaster University, I
  spent 18 years as Senior Research Officer at the IFS, before starting
  my own consultancy, Virtual Worlds. During my time at the IFS, I
  produced a body peer-reviewed journal articles (listed) and reports
  that achieved impact with policy makers and Government departments,
  such as the DSS/DWP and provided rapid response assessment of Budgets
  for media outlets. In this role, I published highly impactful research
  with colleagues such as Paul Johnson, Director of the IFS, Andrew
  Dilnot, Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, and former Director of the
  Institute for Fiscal Studies (1991-2002), Principal of St Hugh’s
  College, Oxford (2002-12), and Chair of the UK Statistics Authority
  (2012-17) and Evan Davis (e.g. Davis et al. 1992).</p>
      <p>After founding Virtual Worlds, an economic microsimulation
  consultation, I expanded my body of work to examine such issues as
  tax, social care and legal aid reform at UK and devolved national
  (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) level. I have also
  provided a range of analyses on tax-benefit reform in other countries,
  including in the US and low-middle income societies in Africa and
  Europe. Importantly, I have created a series of online tools that
  enable users to analyse microsimulation data in accessible form.</p>
      <p>Since 2022, I have been Senior Research Associate in Public Policy
  at Northumbria University, providing economic and microsimulation
  insight that has fed into a series of peer-reviewed publications,
  including two that are in press. In this role, I have developed the
  TriplePC (Public Policy Preference Calculator,
  https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk/), a unique online microsimulation
  tool that enables projection of the health, health economic, economic
  and public opinion impacts of customisable welfare policies, which is
  described in a forthcoming article in the International Journal of
  Microsimulation (Stark et al. 2024).</p>
      <p>This thesis summary examines the underpinning research from three
  recent publications that assess the impact post-Financial Crisis era
  interventions and potential interventions. The first report (Reed
  &amp; Stark 2018) forecasts the impact of the Scottish Government’s
  Child Poverty Plan. The second (Reed &amp; Stark 2020) assess the
  impact of policy for care leavers in England. The final report, which
  summarises the research conducted for Stark et al. (2024), describes
  development of the TriplePC as part of a broader NIHR-funded tranche
  of research on the impact of basic income on poverty, inequality and
  health.</p>

      <title>Chapter 1: Microsimulation modelling</title>
      <p>Microsimulation Modelling</p>
      <p>(Johnson and Stark 19, King and Stark 19xx, Coulter, Heady and
  Stark 199x, King and Stark 1985, Duncan and Stark 20xx)</p>
      <p>Microsimulation is the study of social phenomena using computer
  simulations on individual-level data, such as people and
  companies.</p>
      <p>The canonical microsimulation is the Tax Benefit Model, which
  models the effects of the fiscal system on individuals and households.
  As such, I developed TAXBEN2, the complete model rewrite. An updated
  version of that that model remains in use today. 25 years on it still
  has many technical advantages over competitor models such as Euromod.
  The Institute for Fiscal Studies had a such a model before I joined,
  but it was unsatisfactory in many ways. The application of TAXBEN2
  included analysis of the UK Capital Gains Tax (King and Stark), and
  calculation of the often highly non-linear relationships between what
  people earn and what they get to keep (Duncan &amp; Stark 2000).
  Subsequently, we built similar models for former Soviet Block
  countries using similar methods. Coulter, Stark and Smith (1995)
  describes one such model for the former Czechoslovakia. King and Stark

      <title>Applications of Microsimulation</title>
      <p>(Stark 198x, Dilnot and Stark 19xx 19xx, Johnson and Stark 19xx,
  19xx)</p>
      <p>The most impactful aspect of microsimulation analysis lies in
  forecasting important possible policy changes. Stark (1986) analyses
  the move from taxing husbands and wives jointly to the individual
  taxation we have today. One consequence of that change was that
  families with two earners could now receive more tax allowances than
  families with a single earners, and this paper is one of several I
  wrote exploring proposed ‘transferrable allowances’ that would address
  this. As with all the papers I produced during this period, it is
  possible that some of this analysis seems commonplace now. However,
  the ability to describe the impact of such changes on the incomes of
  different types of family, incentives to work, and tax revenues was
  very new at the time and attracted widespread interest among the
  media, policy makers, and academics.</p>
      <p>For example, Dilnot and Stark (1986a; 1986b) are analyses of the
  now widely-recognised poverty trap. As a family’s income rose from a
  low level, the withdrawal of means-tested benefits along with
  increases in taxes could leave them no better off, or even worse off.
  These papers were the first to show that the numbers of families
  affected by very high withdrawal rates were at the time likely quite
  small. Taper rates in Universal Credit and the general increase in the
  number of people on low incomes means that that number is much higher,
  emphasising that the relevance of the work some 38 years on.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Johnson and Stark (1991) was the first study of the
  distributional effects of a UK minimum wage. It showed that the likely
  gains were mostly amongst second earners, meaning that the gains were
  predominantly to the middle of the income distribution. This result
  was not appreciated at the time, but has largely been overtaken by
  social changes. Johnson and Stark (199) was my attempt at a ‘How to
  Lie with statistics’ paper specifically about tax policy, and written
  as a reaction to media coverage of the tax policies proposed in the
  1992 general election. Stark and Johnson (1989) summarised the
  entirety of the tax and benefit policy of the Thatcher Government in a
  concise but consistent way, showing how overall changes were highly
  regressive. This work, overall, has highlighted the extent to which
  the 1979-1997 Governments produced significant increases in inequality
  and presented analysis of means of achieving progressive reform.</p>

    <sec id="benefit-takeup">
      <title>Benefit Takeup</title>
      <p>(Fry and Stark 198x, 1994; Buck and Stark 20xx, 20yy))</p>
      <p>The UK’s benefit system is largely means-tested. Entitlement to
  Universal Credit, Working Tax Credit and the like depend on family
  income, with benefits being withdrawn as income rise. Along with the
  Poverty Trap discussed above, the key problem with means testing is
  that these benefits may not be claimed, largely because of stigma or
  because of the complexity of claiming them. Ours were the first
  studies to use microsimulation techniques to study non-take up
  (e.g. Fry &amp; Stark 1987; 1992; 1993). A key result is that takeup
  is higher for large entitlements, which provides support for the
  ‘disutility’ model of take-up. Studies using our microsimulation
  methods have since become a mini-industry (Moffat xx, (some
  survey)).</p>
      <p>Highlighting complexity and stigma as likely important factors in
  limiting the effectiveness of means-tested benefits has clear
  relevance to my later work on less conditional welfare reforms, such
  as basic income, but my initial response was to examine more focused
  policies such as Legal Aid Means-Testing. I used microsimulation to
  answer the question: ‘what is the simplest set of rules that could
  achieve some set of objectives - the numbers and types of families
  eligible, overall expenditure and administrative costs and so on?’ The
  work had significant impact, directly contributing to reforms to Legal
  Aid means tests, though the positive impact was largely cancelled out
  by subsequent large cuts to the legal aid budget. Subsequently, there
  was interest in the simplification question in Government, including
  an ‘Office for Tax Simplification’. However, this often combined
  simplification with sweeping distributional changes that produced more
  complex implementation issues.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="budget-analysis">
      <title>Budget Analysis</title>
      <p>One of the key founding missions of IFS was to provide timely,
  detailed analysis of actual and proposed budget changes. My work with
  Paul Johnson, Andrew Dilnot, Evan Davis and others illustrate the
  contribution of microsimulation to this (Johnson &amp; Stark 1991;
  Davis et al. 1992; Johnson, Webb &amp; Stark 1987 Dilnot, et
  al. 1987). These, too, may seem commonplace now, although analysis of
  budgets is mostly focussed on public finances in the aggregate.
  However, at the time, rapid, detailed analysis of the distributional
  and incentive effects of budgets was new and had a huge impact in the
  wider discourse.</p>
      <p>My more recent work in this area includes papers for the Office of
  the Scottish Charities Register (OSCR), which were concerned with
  granting charitable status to institutions, such as private schools or
  golf clubs, that few people could afford (Reed &amp; Stark 2009). I
  first examined the literature on affordability as applied to, for
  example, affordable housing, fines levied by the courts and fuel
  poverty. I then described a microsimulation model that shows the
  proportions of households who might be able to afford the proposed
  fees of some applicant for charitable status. Again, I believe this
  was the first model of its kind.</p>

      <title>Chapter 3: Microsimulation of policies for which there is no
  precedent: basic income</title>
      <p>Prospective welfare policies have often been assessed on their
  financial impacts, for example, their effects on net household incomes
  and marginal and average tax rates. However, welfare policies can also
  have a substantial effect on population health and wellbeing. In
  addition, politicians must consider the electoral implications of
  policies that would affect large sections of the population. In my
  third report, Treating Causes not Symptoms (Johnson et al. 2023), I
  describe the Public Policy Preference Calculator (TriplePC), a new
  microsimulation model that seeks to extend the microsimulation in two
  ways.</p>
      <p>First, as well as modelling the outcomes of a policy in the
  conventional way, our model uses Conjoint Analysis of public
  acceptability data to give an indication of the policy’s popularity.
  This is novel and important. There are measures that might actually be
  popular with , but which policymakers have been unwilling to touch
  because of uncertainty about their electoral consequences. Perhaps the
  best example from UK history is the SDP/Liberal Democrat’s ‘Dead
  Parrot’ merger manifesto of January 1988 (Gourley, n.d.; Crewe &amp;
  King, 1995), which proposed the abolition of Child Benefit and the
  imposition of a uniform rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to raise money
  for an anti-poverty program. Although this had been modelled in
  detail, fear of the electoral consequences among Members of Parliament
  meant the manifesto was abandoned within a day. The resulting
  confusion and indecision arguably caused long-lasting damage to
  centrist politics in the UK (Crewe &amp; King, 1995). The UK’s
  zero-rating for food and children’s clothing remains politically
  untouchable to this day despite the orthodox economic arguments in
  favour of a uniform rate (Crawford et al., 2010). But would VAT
  extension really be unpopular, especially if it was part of a package
  that used the money raised for poverty reduction or other appealing
  policies? Our approach allows us to address questions like this.</p>
      <p>Second, I integrated health outcomes into the model. There is
  strong evidence that welfare policies can have a substantial effect on
  population health (Johnson et al., 2022). A stark reminder of the real
  impact of worsening population health can be seen in the proportion of
  the UK population with a long-standing illness, disability or
  impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day
  activities. This is estimated to have risen from 19% in 2011/12 to 24%
  in 2021/22, an increase of 3.9 million people (Department for Work and
  Pensions, 2023). Indeed, the estimate increased from 14.1 million in
  2019/20 to 16.0 million in 2021/22 (Department for Work and Pensions,
  2023). Interestingly, the proportion among state pension age adults
  has remained the same between 2011/12 and 2021/22 at 45%, whereas for
  working-age adults it has increased from 16% to 23% and for children
  the figures are 6% to 11%. This suggests that increases in prevalence
  are not simply the effect of an ageing population (Department for Work
  and Pensions, 2023).</p>
      <p>In that context, it is essential that policymakers invest real
  thought in realising the Government’s prevention agenda (Department of
  Health and Social Care, 2018), which was incorporated into the 2019
  NHS England Long Term Plan (NHS England, 2019). Forty-three years on
  from the Black Report which highlighted the role of material
  circumstances on health inequalities (Working Group on Inequalities in
  Health, 1980), 13 since the Marmot Review (Marmot et al., 2010) and
  three since its 10-years-on update (Marmot et al., 2020) which
  highlighted worsening trends in inequalities, there is good reason to
  examine and tackle social determinants of health.</p>
      <p>Some of the authors of this article (Johnson et al., 2022) have
  called for trials of cash transfers, in particular Basic Income, as an
  upstream intervention to mitigate poverty, inequality and insecurity
  as social determinants of mental and physical ill-health. Systematic
  reviews of cash transfer schemes that resemble Basic Income, such as
  Gibson et al. (2020), have indicated positive impacts on mental and
  physical health, hospital attendance and health related behaviour,
  such as alcohol and drug use. In contrast, conditional, means- and
  needs-based welfare systems in high-income countries are associated
  with below average health outcomes (Shahidi et al., 2019) and
  increased psychological distress prevalence (Wickham et al., 2020). We
  have suggested several explanations (Johnson et al., 2022): schemes
  are ‘insufficient to offset the negative health consequences of severe
  socioeconomic disadvantage’ (Shahidi et al., 2019); conditionality and
  assessment inflicts stress (Dwyer et al., 2020) and creates perverse
  incentives for health-diminishing behaviour (Johnson et al., 2022);
  and focusing on the poorest fails to mitigate broader determinants
  that affect society as a whole (Marmot et al., 2010).</p>
      <p>There are existing health simulations for the UK. Public Health
  Scotland’s Informing Interventions to reduce health Inequalities
  (Triple I) tools focus on comparing the effects and costs of a range
  of tax-benefit (including a Basic Income) changes as well as
  non-economic programmes such as a lifestyle weight management service,
  20-mile-per-hour speed limits or Alcohol Brief Interventions. Effects
  and costs modelled are based on premature deaths, years of life lost
  and hospital stays, with changes population health and inequalities as
  the key measures. It does not model the economic impacts on household
  types nor public preferences.</p>
      <p>Most other health microsimulations tend to model the economic
  effects of health, rather than the other way round (Schofield et al.,
  2017). There are some that model the effects of, potentially economic,
  interventions on health, particularly with regard to extrapolating
  from childhood and adolescence, for example, the University of York’s
  LifeSim (Skarda et al., 2021).</p>
      <p>I therefore decided to create microsimulation with a public-facing
  user interface – the Public Policy Preference Calculator (TriplePC) –
  that would enable automated assessment of economic and health impacts
  as well as public preferences between different welfare and tax
  policies. The TriplePC model project therefore had three strands:</p>

      <p>We discuss these in turn.</p>

    <sec id="public-preferences-conjoint-analysis">
      <title>Public preferences: Conjoint analysis</title>
      <p>Conjoint analysis (Hainmueller et al., 2013) is a survey-based
  technique originally developed as a market research tool, to examine
  how consumers value characteristics (sweetness, colour, alcohol
  content, etc.) of goods. Recently, the technique has become popular as
  a method for discovering the public’s relative valuations of competing
  economic or social policies (Bremer &amp; Bürgisser, 2023). Research
  comparing conjoint survey experiments to actual votes has shown that
  the conjoint results are good predictors of voting outcomes (Bansak et
  al., 2023).</p>
      <p>Our study is described in full in (Nettle et al., 2023), with the
  data available as (Johnson et al., 2023). The authors of that study
  recruited 800 UK resident adults through the Prolific online platform.
  Participants were asked repeatedly to choose their preferred welfare
  policy from sets of two. Each time, the two policies contained the
  same input (design) and outcome (health and distributional) attributes
  but with randomised levels in each (e.g. payment sizes of £63 per
  child, £145 per adult and £190 per pensioner; poverty decreased by 25%
  etc.). Each participant completed 15 choice tasks. Each option within
  each task was defined by 10 attributes. Each attribute had three to
  nine possible levels. Table 1 shows the full list of 10 attributes
  with between three and nine levels each.</p>
      <p>Relative to the UK population, the sample contained an
  over-representation of people who</p>
      <p>voted for the left to centre-left Labour party at the 2019 general
  election (44.3% of those in</p>
      <p>our sample who voted, vs. 32.1% election result); and an
  under-representation of those</p>
      <p>who voted for the right to centre-right Conservative party (31.8%
  versus 43.6% election</p>
      <p>result). Although we did create survey weights to correct for this,
  TriplePC currently uses unweighted data.</p>
      <p>All options were fully randomly generated from the possible
  combinations. Instructions in the survey explained that participants
  might prefer some features in one policy and some in the other, but
  they needed to consider which policy they preferred overall. The
  attributes on which the policies varied were explained in greater
  depth prior to the first choice task, and then described just with
  brief phrases during the choice tasks themselves. Note that many of
  these randomly generated pairs are totally implausible. This is
  integral to how a fully randomized conjoint analysis works: by
  generating all the possible combinations, things that are actually
  correlated in real life (e.g. tax rates and poverty rates) are
  rendered orthogonal to one another. It is this that allows
  identification of their independent marginal effects.</p>
      <p>We simultaneously estimated the average impact of preference or
  dis-preference for particular feature attribute-value on preference
  for policies overall using comparable scales through computation of
  Average Marginal Component Effects (AMCEs) (Hainmueller et al., 2013)
  from linear probability models. The AMCE for a given level of an
  attribute can be interpreted as the marginal effect on the probability
  of choice of the attribute being at that level compared to the
  reference level, averaging across the possible levels of all other
  attributes. Through randomization and a high number of pairwise
  comparisons, this allows us to quantify the causal effect of including
  specific levels of individual reform elements on the support for the
  entire reform package, compared with the support for a reform package
  that contains the baseline level (status quo) of this particular
  reform element (Nettle et al., 2023a). That study found:</p>
      <list list-type="bullet">
        <list-item>
          <p>preference for more generous payments than less generous
      ones.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>strong preference for decreases in poverty (compared to the
      status quo).</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>preferences on tax rates depended on the broad effects of the
      policy package. Increasing personal income tax rates were popular
      if the package they were part of also decreased poverty, and
      unpopular otherwise.</p>
        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>preference for a wealth tax, carbon taxes, and increased

        </list-item>
        <list-item>
          <p>other health and wellbeing consequences also had some
      significant marginal effects above and beyond those of poverty and
      inequality. An increase in life expectancy of five years was
      significantly preferred to the status quo, and a decrease in life

        <list-item>
          <p>dis-preference for increased rates of anxiety and depression

  welfare policy the user wishes to specify through the interface from
  the data of Nettle et al. (2023a, b). In the conjoint methodology,
  these are assumed to have an additive effect on popularity. That is,
  for example, the popularity of a policy combining high income taxes,
  carbon tax, and a decrease in poverty will be the sum of the negative
  marginal effect on popularity of the high income tax, the positive
  marginal effect on popularity of the carbon tax, the positive marginal
  effect of the poverty reduction, and so on. This summation is the
  popularity outcome returned by the model.</p>
      <p>The conjoint analysis was conducted ahead of the construction of
  the microsimulation model. As we discuss below, some of the measures
  in Table 1 (income tax, payment sizes, poverty and inequality rates)
  are reasonably straightforward to model (though there are issues
  around definitions). Others, such as the ‘other funding’ options and
  the relationship between income and health, are harder.</p>

        <title>Modelling health outcomes</title>
        <p>We model two health measures: mental health and life expectancy.
    We build a model relating SF-12 scores (Ware, 2002) to income and
    demographic characteristics. SF-12 is a widely used measure of an
    individual’s health-related quality of life, with two summary
    scores: the Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and the Mental
    Component Summary (MCS-12). The model is estimated over 12 waves
    (2009/11-2020/22) of Understanding Society: The UK Household
    Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) (Institute for Social and Economic
    Research, 2023) panel data (Reed et al., 2024).1 Another companion
    article (Reed et al., 2023a) discusses this modelling in detail.</p>
        <sec id="health-modelling-strategy">
          <title>Health modelling strategy</title>
          <p>Our health model is estimated using the ‘between’ individual
      coefficient from a fixed effects ‘within-between’ model, which
      combines the effect on physical and mental health of both an
      individual’s income in one wave vs their average across waves, and
      their average across waves compared with the sample average.</p>
          <p>The model is a reformulation of the standard Mundlak model and
      has a significant advantage in being able to retain the
      flexibility of random effects models while reducing concerns about
      bias that fixed effects models address (Bell et al., 2019; Bell
      &amp; Jones, 2015). The within-between model, conceptually,
      captures several key income-based drivers of health,
      including:</p>

          <p>It does not, however, capture what we anticipate through our
      model of impact (Johnson et al., 2022) to be very substantial
      benefits from systems such as Basic Income of increased security
      of income and protection from destitution for a very large
      proportion of the population in even relatively highly paid jobs.
      We use the between-individual coefficient in our modelling because
      changes to the welfare system are more likely to reflect permanent
      income shocks. The SF-12 regression are available in a working
      paper (Reed et al., 2024).</p>

      life expectancy from SF-12 in three steps:</p>

      Mental Health outputs are shown in the bottom left row. As
      modelled, mental health appears rather unresponsive to changes in
      income. For example, choosing the most generous benefit increases
      from the options from the Conjoint Analysis – a package costing
      £430bn – would reduce the number of adults with critically low
      SF-12 scores (below 45.6) by about 3%.</p>

        <title>Microsimulation: The TriplePC model</title>
        <p>In conjoint surveys, respondents have preferences over inputs
    (income tax rates, payment sizes, etc.) and outcomes (poverty and
    inequality levels, numbers of mental health cases, etc.). We use
    microsimulation to bridge between them</p>
        <p>The analysis uses a heavily adapted version of Scotben (Stark
    2023a), an open-source microsimulation model of Scotland written in
    the Julia programming language. Scotben is a conventionally
    structured static tax-benefit model, in the family of models
    branching out from the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ TAXBEN (Johnson
    et al., 1990) of which two of this article’s authors (Reed and
    Stark) were developers. For this project, we extended the scope of
    the model to Great Britain2 using a single 2021/22 wave of Family
    Resources Survey (FRS) data (Department for Work and Pensions,
    2019). The model covers the whole of the UK personal tax and benefit
    system, including local taxes, with some minor exceptions such as
    Scottish Best Starts grants. As a base, we use the tax and benefit
    system as of Q3 2023, and all incomes, wealth and consumption are
    also uprated to 2023 Q3. We use the 2021/22 FRS sample weights
    as-is.</p>
        <p>The outcome questions are phrased as changes (e.g. ‘50% fewer
    cases of anxiety and depression’, ‘Poverty increased by 50%’). A
    particularly tricky question arising from this is how to establish a
    baseline for comparison. The conjoint experiment survey had no ‘keep
    things as they are’ option for the tax and benefit inputs, so there
    were two options for the TriplePC:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Using a tax-benefit system some way from the current one as
        baseline and assuming that the outcome changes represent changes
        in poverty, health, etc. from that point, rather than changes
        from the actual current situation.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Using the current system as the baseline, but then the
        default output will have significant deviations for the outcome
        variables.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Neither of these choices is good but on balance we decided 1) was
    the least bad. I It makes the conjoint popularity output much easier
    to understand: with option 2) we would be applying large changes in
    poverty and inequality to the base conjoint results which would make
    those results very unintuitive. The result, however, is that the
    model starts some distance from the actual existing system. This is
    certainly a lesson for future work.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="income-tax-rates">
        <title>Income tax rates</title>
        <p>The conjoint experimental survey had six income tax rate options
    with a basic, higher and additional rate in each (see Table 1). The
    first of these options is the current non-Scottish UK income tax
    rates, which we take as the base.3 All other options represent rate
    increases. We assume the corresponding thresholds are as present.
    Since we have to remain consistent with the conjoint analysis, only
    the six rate groups in Table 1 are presented to the user, though the
    model can handle any combination of rates and thresholds. We assume
    no behavioural responses to changing tax rates and make no
    corrections for under-reporting of incomes beyond that embodied in
    the FRS sample weights.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="benefits">
        <title>Benefits</title>
        <p>The payment size question in the conjoint survey was about a
    hypothetical system of payments that most closely reflects the
    simplicity of Basic Income (Reed et al., 2023b). There were also
    questions about eligibility, means-testing and citizenship (see
    Table 1, above). It is not clear how this proposed system of cash
    transfers should interact with the existing tax and benefit system,
    especially bearing in mind that the question is not how an expert
    believes they should interact, but what was most likely in the mind
    of the conjoint respondents. We follow our recent analysis (Reed et
    al., 2023b) and assume:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>means-tested benefits are retained.4</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>most other benefits, including the State Pension and Child
        Benefit, are abolished and replaced by the cash transfers.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Needs-based benefits such as those based on sickness or
        disability, like Personal Independence Payment (PIP), are
        retained.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The least generous set of options (Child - £0; Adult - £63;
    Pensioner - £190) are taken as the base values. Compared to the
    actual system, this means that we’re starting from a social security
    system that’s considerably more expensive (because of the adult
    payments), but where pensioners are usually slightly worse off (£190
    vs £203.85 for the new State Pension) and families with large
    numbers of children not on means-tested benefits are worse off,
    since the cash transfer to children is zero in the default case and
    the payments to adults are not always enough to compensate. We do
    not adjust taxes to meet these extra base costs. For eligibility,
    means-testing and citizenship options, it seemed plausible that at
    least some of the respondents might be aware of the means and
    eligibility tests from existing benefits. Consequently, we model the
    eligibility rules that apply to the ‘legacy’ UK benefits: Working
    Tax Credit and Income Support/Employment Support that are in the
    process of being phased out, and the means-tests are taken from the
    new Universal Credit (Child Poverty Action Group, 2022).</p>

        <p>Table 1 includes a number of ‘other funding’ options that are
    worth discussing briefly.</p>
        <p>There is ambiguity in some of these options. A wealth tax or
    carbon levy could be implemented in many ways, for instance; we make
    what we hope are reasonable assumptions for these cases, but for the
    microsimulation to be fully consistent with the conjoint survey we
    would have to know what was in the mind of the respondents. This

          <title>‘Increase in VAT’ (Value Added Tax)</title>
          <p>Our Family Resources Survey (FRS) dataset has no expenditure
      data. The main UK source of household expenditure data is the
      Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF) (Office for National
      Statistics, 2019a). To model the complex set of VAT exemptions and
      zero-rated goods5, we therefore have three choices:</p>

          supplanted by the FRS. LCF remains the source used in the
          Treasury’s IGOTM model (Brice, 2015). But to model other
          options such as wealth taxes, we would need still other
          datasets. Switching between multiple different datasets, and
          hence slightly different base outcomes, depending on which
          options were being modelled could be confusing.</p>

              <p>Imputing expenditure data onto the FRS via a demand system.
          This seems appealing as the model would be consistent with
          economic theory, expenditure could vary with tax rates, and,
          in principle, we could use the demand system to calculate
          changes in economic welfare rather than just estimate cash
          changes. But it is infeasible to build a demand system with
          fine enough detail to adequately model the complex set of
          exemptions and zero-rated goods.

          group of LCF donors in the conventional way (matching on age,

      problems with under-reporting LCF expenditure data such as of
      alcohol and tobacco spending (Reed 2012) which will account for
      much of this. For this exercise, we provide a crude fix by
      grossing up all the expenditure records by 1.5. Undoubtedly this
      is an area we can improve on.</p>

          </list>
          <p>To solve 1., we impute data from the Wealth and Assets Survey
      (WAS) (Office for National Statistics, 2019b) onto the FRS
      households. We chose to do this using a simple linear regression
      of three categories of wealth (pensions, housing, and financial
      and other assets) against household characteristics that are
      common to FRS and WAS. In retrospect, regression-based imputation
      was likely a mistake and matching will be used in future
      versions.</p>
          <p>For the form of the tax, we were guided by the Wealth Tax
      Commission (Advani et al., 2020). We followed their
      recommendations of excluding pension wealth, having an allowance
      of £500,000, and having the tax payable over five years, though we
      deviated from the Commission in applying the tax to aggregate
      household wealth rather than individual wealth (Chamberlain,
      2020).</p>
          <p>Even when payable over five years, as recommended by the Wealth
      Tax Commission, the payments from wealth taxes needed to fund some
      of the more generous benefit schemes can exceed net income for
      many families, especially elderly families who have high housing
      wealth. Most likely the scheme would need to be augmented by an
      income-related rebate scheme, or some scheme to defer until
      death.</p>

        <sec id="corporation-tax-increases">
          <title>‘Corporation tax increases’</title>
          <p>Building a plausible micro-data based model of Corporation Tax
      is difficult and not something that could be contemplated for this
      project. In any case, for a household-based microsimulation model,
      what matters is the incidence of the tax on the households. This
      could be on profits, or passed on in price increases or real wage
      reductions (Harberger, 1962; Atkinson &amp; Stiglitz, 2015). If we
      make a simple ‘small country’ assumption – that the rate of return
      on capital and the price of tradeable goods are set exogenously on
      world markets – then Corporation Tax is ultimately incident on
      (private sector) wages and self-employment income. Therefore, we
      calculate the tax increase needed to meet the costs of the benefit
      increase and reduce the wage bill by that amount. Note that as the
      wage bill falls, direct tax revenues also fall, but in a
      non-linear way because of the tax allowance and progressive tax
      rate structures, so finding the correct Corporation Tax increase
      requires the use of our root-finder. In practice the rates needed
      for the more generous benefit increases can be implausibly large,
      exceeding in some cases total UK Corporation’s Gross Profits.</p>

            <p>Careful thought must be given to the definition of the base
        case the model is comparing against.</p>

        <p>There are also interesting questions about how best to present
    results of a model with such diverse outputs. For instance, since
    one is a stock and the other a flow, can we count payments by a
    household from a wealth tax in the same way as payments for income
    tax? And should we be imputing a monetary value to any health
    improvements?</p>
        <p>I have presented the TriplePC, a new microsimulation model with
    novel but important features. We have established the importance and
    practicality of using conjoint data to provide instant analysis of
    the political implications of welfare packages, but also learned
    some important lessons on how best to conduct integrated
    microsimulation and conjoint analysis. We have also estimated new
    measures of the relationship between income and health and shown how
    these, too, can be integrated into the model. The TriplePC is
    available online at https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk/ and its
    source code, linked on the main site, is released under an
    open-source licence.</p>
