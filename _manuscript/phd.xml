      <p>My PhD thesis builds on decades of academic research conducted as
  Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), the
  Open University and as Director of Virtual Worlds. I present three
  publications developed in my role as Senior Research Policy at
  Northumbria which emerges from this work. I am a leading specialist in
  microsimulation modelling of tax-benefit systems, programming
  software, databases and interfaces. Most significantly, I am the
  creator of TAXBEN
  (<xref alt="Johnson, Webb and Stark, 1990" rid="ref-johnson_taxben2_1990" ref-type="bibr">Johnson,
  Webb and Stark, 1990</xref>), the IFS’ tax and benefit microsimulation
  model
  (<xref alt="Giles and McCrae, 1995" rid="ref-giles_taxbenU003A_1995" ref-type="bibr">Giles
  and McCrae, 1995</xref>), which continues to be used to analyse
  Government tax-benefit reform.</p>
      <p>Having started my career in Economics at Lancaster University, I
  spent 18 years as Senior Research Officer at the IFS, before starting
  my own consultancy, Virtual Worlds. During my time at the IFS, I
  produced a body peer-reviewed journal articles (listed) and reports
  that achieved impact with policy makers and Government departments,
  such as the DSS/DWP and provided rapid response assessment of Budgets
  for media outlets. In this role, I published highly impactful research
  with colleagues such as Paul Johnson, Director of the IFS, Andrew
  Dilnot, Warden of Nuffield College, Oxford, and former Director of the
  Institute for Fiscal Studies (1991-2002), Principal of St Hugh’s
  College, Oxford (2002-12), and Chair of the UK Statistics Authority
  (2012-17) and Evan Davis (e.g. Davis et al. 1992).</p>
      <p>After founding Virtual Worlds, an economic microsimulation
  consultation, I expanded my body of work to examine such issues as
  tax, social care and legal aid reform at UK and devolved national
  (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) level. I have also
  provided a range of analyses on tax-benefit reform in other countries,
  including in the US and low-middle income societies in Africa and
  Europe. Importantly, I have created a series of online tools that
  enable users to analyse microsimulation data in accessible form.</p>
      <p>Since 2022, I have been Senior Research Associate in Public Policy
  at Northumbria University, providing economic and microsimulation
  insight that has fed into a series of peer-reviewed publications,
  including two that are in press. In this role, I have developed the
  TriplePC (Public Policy Preference Calculator,
  https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk/), a unique online microsimulation
  tool that enables projection of the health, health economic, economic
  and public opinion impacts of customisable welfare policies, which is
  described in a forthcoming article in the International Journal of
  Microsimulation
  (<xref alt="Stark et al., 2024" rid="ref-stark_public_2024" ref-type="bibr">Stark
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>).</p>
      <p>This thesis summary examines the underpinning research from three
  recent publications that assess the impact post-Financial Crisis era
  interventions and potential interventions. The first report
  (<xref alt="Reed and Stark, 2018" rid="ref-reed_tackling_2018" ref-type="bibr">Reed
  and Stark, 2018</xref>) forecasts the impact of the Scottish
  Government’s Child Poverty Plan. The second
  (<xref alt="Reed and Stark, 2020" rid="ref-reed_giving_2020" ref-type="bibr">Reed
  and Stark, 2020</xref>) assess the impact of policy for care leavers
  in England. The final report, which summarises the research conducted
  for Stark et al.
  (<xref alt="Stark et al., 2024" rid="ref-stark_public_2024" ref-type="bibr">Stark
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>), describes development of the
  TriplePC as part of a broader NIHR-funded tranche of research on the
  impact of basic income on poverty, inequality and health.</p>

      <p>Microsimulation Modelling is:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>the application of simulation methods to micro data for the
    purposes of evaluating the effectiveness and improving the design of
    public policy. The field has existed for over 50 years and has been
    applied to many different policy areas and is a methodology that is
    applied within both government and academia.
    [odonoghue_handbook_2014]</p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>The canonical microsimulation is the Tax Benefit Model, which
  models the effects of the fiscal system on individuals and
  households.</p>
      <p>As such, I developed TAXBEN2, the complete model rewrite. An
  updated version of that that model remains in use today. 25 years on
  it still has many technical advantages over competitor models such as
  Euromod. The Institute for Fiscal Studies had a such a model before I
  joined, but it was unsatisfactory in many ways. The application of
  TAXBEN2 included analysis of the UK Capital Gains Tax
  (<xref alt="Stark and King, 1986" rid="ref-stark_modelling_1986" ref-type="bibr">Stark
  and King, 1986</xref>), and calculation of the often highly non-linear
  relationships between what people earn and what they get to keep
  (<xref alt="Duncan and Stark, 2000" rid="ref-duncan_recursive_2000" ref-type="bibr">Duncan
  and Stark, 2000</xref>). Subsequently, we built similar models for
  former Soviet Block countries using similar methods.
  (<xref alt="Coulter, Stark and Smith, 1995" rid="ref-coulter_micro-simulation_1995" ref-type="bibr">Coulter,

      <p>The most impactful aspect of microsimulation analysis lies in
  forecasting important possible policy changes.
  (<xref alt="STARK, 1988" rid="ref-stark_partially_1988" ref-type="bibr">STARK,
  1988</xref>) analyses the move from taxing husbands and wives jointly
  to the individual taxation we have today. One consequence of that
  change was that families with two earners could now receive more tax
  allowances than families with a single earners, and this paper is one
  of several I wrote exploring proposed ‘transferrable allowances’ that
  would address this. As with all the papers I produced during this
  period, it is possible that some of this analysis seems commonplace
  now. However, the ability to describe the impact of such changes on
  the incomes of different types of family, incentives to work, and tax
  revenues was very new at the time and attracted widespread interest
  among the media, policy makers, and academics.</p>
      <p>For example,
  (<xref alt="DILNOT and STARK, 1986" rid="ref-dilnot_poverty_1986" ref-type="bibr">DILNOT
  and STARK, 1986</xref>;
  <xref alt="DILNOT, STARK and WEBB, 1987" rid="ref-dilnot_targeting_1987" ref-type="bibr">DILNOT,
  STARK and WEBB, 1987</xref>) are analyses of the now widely-recognised
  poverty trap. As a family’s income rose from a low level, the
  withdrawal of means-tested benefits along with increases in taxes
  could leave them no better off, or even worse off. These papers were
  the first to show that the numbers of families affected by very high
  withdrawal rates were at the time likely quite small. Taper rates in
  Universal Credit and the general increase in the number of people on
  low incomes means that that number is much higher, emphasising that
  the relevance of the work some 38 years on.</p>
      <p>Likewise,
  (<xref alt="JOHNSON and STARK, 1991" rid="ref-johnson_effects_1991" ref-type="bibr">JOHNSON
  and STARK, 1991</xref>) was the first study of the distributional
  effects of a UK minimum wage. It showed that the likely gains were
  mostly amongst second earners, meaning that the gains were
  predominantly to the middle of the income distribution. This result
  was not appreciated at the time, but has largely been overtaken by
  social changes. Johnson and Stark (199) was my attempt at a ‘How to
  Lie with statistics’ paper specifically about tax policy, and written
  as a reaction to media coverage of the tax policies proposed in the
  1992 general election.
  (<xref alt="JOHNSON and STARK, 1989" rid="ref-johnson_ten_1989-1" ref-type="bibr">JOHNSON
  and STARK, 1989</xref>) summarised the entirety of the tax and benefit
  policy of the Thatcher Government in a concise but consistent way,
  showing how overall changes were highly regressive. This work,
  overall, has highlighted the extent to which the 1979-1997 Governments
  produced significant increases in inequality and presented analysis of
  means of achieving progressive reform.</p>
      <sec id="benefit-takeup">
        <title>Benefit Takeup</title>
        <p>(<xref alt="FRY and STARK, 1987" rid="ref-fry_take-up_1987" ref-type="bibr">FRY

        <p>The UK’s benefit system is largely means-tested. Entitlement to
    Universal Credit, Working Tax Credit and the like depend on family
    income, with benefits being withdrawn as income rise. Along with the
    Poverty Trap discussed above, the key problem with means testing is
    that these benefits may not be claimed, largely because of stigma or
    because of the complexity of claiming them. Ours were the first
    studies to use microsimulation techniques to study non-take up
    (<xref alt="FRY and STARK, 1987" rid="ref-fry_take-up_1987" ref-type="bibr">FRY
    and STARK, 1987</xref>;
    <xref alt="Fry and Stark, 1993" rid="ref-fry_take-up_1993-1" ref-type="bibr">Fry
    and Stark, 1993</xref>). A key result is that takeup is higher for
    large entitlements, which provides support for the ‘disutility’
    model of take-up. Studies using our microsimulation methods have
    since become a mini-industry (, [ko_take-up_2022;Brewer
    (<xref alt="2003" rid="ref-brewer_estimating_2003" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>)]).</p>
        <p>Highlighting complexity and stigma as likely important factors in
    limiting the effectiveness of means-tested benefits has clear
    relevance to my later work on less conditional welfare reforms, such
    as basic income, but my initial response was to examine more focused
    policies such as Legal Aid Means-Testing. Along with Alexy Buck of
    the Legal Services Commission Buck and Stark
    (<xref alt="2003" rid="ref-buck_simplicity_2003" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>),I
    used microsimulation to answer the question: ‘what is the simplest
    set of rules that could achieve some set of objectives - the numbers
    and types of families eligible, overall expenditure and
    administrative costs and so on?’ The work had significant impact,
    directly contributing to reforms to Legal Aid means tests, though
    the positive impact was largely cancelled out by subsequent large
    cuts to the legal aid budget. Subsequently, there was interest in
    the simplification question in Government, including an ‘Office for
    Tax Simplification’. However, this often combined simplification
    with sweeping distributional changes that produced more complex
    implementation issues.</p>

      <sec id="budget-analysis">
        <title>Budget Analysis</title>
        <p>One of the key founding missions of IFS was to provide timely,
    detailed analysis of actual and proposed budget changes. My work
    with Paul Johnson, Andrew Dilnot, Evan Davis and others illustrate
    the contribution of microsimulation to this
    (<xref alt="DILNOT et al., 1987" rid="ref-dilnot-fs-1987" ref-type="bibr">DILNOT

    <xref alt="JOHNSON and STARK, 1993" rid="ref-johnson_assessing_1993" ref-type="bibr">JOHNSON
    and STARK, 1993</xref>). These, too, may seem commonplace now,
    although analysis of budgets is mostly focussed on public finances
    in the aggregate. However, at the time, rapid, detailed analysis of
    the distributional and incentive effects of budgets was new and had
    a huge impact in the wider discourse.</p>
        <p>My more recent work in this area includes papers for the Office
    of the Scottish Charities Register (OSCR) , which were concerned
    with granting charitable status to institutions, such as private
    schools or golf clubs, that few people could afford
    (<xref alt="Stark, 2009" rid="ref-stark_assessing_2009" ref-type="bibr">Stark,
    2009</xref>). I first examined the literature on affordability as
    applied to, for example, affordable housing, fines levied by the
    courts and fuel poverty. I then described a microsimulation model
    that shows the proportions of households who might be able to afford
    the proposed fees of some applicant for charitable status. Again, I
    believe this was the first model of its kind.</p>

      <title>Chapter 3: Microsimulation of policies for which there is no

      <p>Prospective welfare policies have often been assessed on their
  financial impacts, for example, their effects on net household incomes
  and marginal and average tax rates. However, welfare policies can also
  have a substantial effect on population health and wellbeing. In
  addition, politicians must consider the electoral implications of
  policies that would affect large sections of the population. In my
  third report, Treating Causes not Symptoms
  (<xref alt="Johnson et al., 2023" rid="ref-johnson_treating_2023" ref-type="bibr">Johnson
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>), I describe the
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk">Public
  Policy Preference Calculator (TriplePC)</ext-link>, a new
  microsimulation model that seeks to extend the microsimulation in two
  ways.</p>
      <p>First, as well as modelling the outcomes of a policy in the
  conventional way, our model uses Conjoint Analysis of public
  acceptability data to give an indication of the policy’s popularity.
  This is novel and important. There are measures that might actually be
  popular with , but which policymakers have been unwilling to touch
  because of uncertainty about their electoral consequences. Perhaps the
  best example from UK history is the SDP/Liberal Democrat’s ‘Dead
  Parrot’ merger manifesto of January 1988
  (<xref alt="Crewe and King, 1995a" rid="ref-crewe_merger_1995" ref-type="bibr">Crewe
  and King, 1995a</xref>;
  <xref alt="Gourley, 2020" rid="ref-gourley_dead_2020" ref-type="bibr">Gourley,
  2020</xref>), which proposed the abolition of Child Benefit and the
  imposition of a uniform rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) to raise money
  for an anti-poverty program. Although this had been modelled in
  detail, fear of the electoral consequences among Members of Parliament
  meant the manifesto was abandoned within a day. The resulting
  confusion and indecision arguably caused long-lasting damage to
  centrist politics in the UK
  (<xref alt="Crewe and King, 1995b" rid="ref-10.1093U002FosoU002F9780198280507.001.0001" ref-type="bibr">Crewe
  and King, 1995b</xref>). The UK’s zero-rating for food and children’s
  clothing remains politically untouchable to this day despite the
  orthodox economic arguments in favour of a uniform rate
  (<xref alt="Crawford, Keen and Smith, 2010" rid="ref-crawford_dimensions_2010" ref-type="bibr">Crawford,
  Keen and Smith, 2010</xref>). But would VAT extension really be
  unpopular, especially if it was part of a package that used the money
  raised for poverty reduction or other appealing policies? Our approach
  allows us to address questions like this.</p>
      <p>Second, I integrated health outcomes into the model. There is
  strong evidence that welfare policies can have a substantial effect on
  population health
  (<xref alt="Reed et al., 2024" rid="ref-reed_examining_2024" ref-type="bibr">Reed
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2024</xref>). A stark reminder of the real
  impact of worsening population health can be seen in the proportion of
  the UK population with a long-standing illness, disability or
  impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day
  activities. This is estimated to have risen from 19% in 2011/12 to 24%
  in 2021/22, an increase of 3.9 million people (Department for Work and
  Pensions, 2023). Indeed, the estimate increased from 14.1 million in
  2019/20 to 16.0 million in 2021/22 (Department for Work and Pensions,
  2023). Interestingly, the proportion among state pension age adults
  has remained the same between 2011/12 and 2021/22 at 45%, whereas for
  working-age adults it has increased from 16% to 23% and for children
  the figures are 6% to 11%. This suggests that increases in prevalence
  are not simply the effect of an ageing population (Department for Work
  and Pensions, 2023).</p>
      <p>In that context, it is essential that policymakers invest real
  thought in realising the Government’s prevention agenda (Department of
  Health and Social Care, 2018), which was incorporated into the 2019
  NHS England Long Term Plan (NHS England, 2019). Forty-three years on
  from the Black Report which highlighted the role of material
  circumstances on health inequalities (Working Group on Inequalities in
  Health, 1980), 13 since the Marmot Review (Marmot et al., 2010) and
  three since its 10-years-on update (Marmot et al., 2020) which
  highlighted worsening trends in inequalities, there is good reason to
  examine and tackle social determinants of health.</p>
      <p>Some of the authors of this article (Johnson et al., 2022) have
  called for trials of cash transfers, in particular Basic Income, as an
  upstream intervention to mitigate poverty, inequality and insecurity
  as social determinants of mental and physical ill-health. Systematic
  reviews of cash transfer schemes that resemble Basic Income, such as
  Gibson et al. (2020), have indicated positive impacts on mental and
  physical health, hospital attendance and health related behaviour,
  such as alcohol and drug use. In contrast, conditional, means- and
  needs-based welfare systems in high-income countries are associated
  with below average health outcomes (Shahidi et al., 2019) and
  increased psychological distress prevalence (Wickham et al., 2020). We
  have suggested several explanations (Johnson et al., 2022): schemes
  are ‘insufficient to offset the negative health consequences of severe
  socioeconomic disadvantage’ (Shahidi et al., 2019); conditionality and
  assessment inflicts stress (Dwyer et al., 2020) and creates perverse
  incentives for health-diminishing behaviour (Johnson et al., 2022);
  and focusing on the poorest fails to mitigate broader determinants
  that affect society as a whole (Marmot et al., 2010).</p>
      <p>There are existing health simulations for the UK. Public Health
  Scotland’s Informing Interventions to reduce health Inequalities
  (Triple I) tools focus on comparing the effects and costs of a range
  of tax-benefit (including a Basic Income) changes as well as
  non-economic programmes such as a lifestyle weight management service,
  20-mile-per-hour speed limits or Alcohol Brief Interventions. Effects
  and costs modelled are based on premature deaths, years of life lost
  and hospital stays, with changes population health and inequalities as
  the key measures. It does not model the economic impacts on household
  types nor public preferences.</p>
      <p>Most other health microsimulations tend to model the economic
  effects of health, rather than the other way round (Schofield et al.,
  2017). There are some that model the effects of, potentially economic,
  interventions on health, particularly with regard to extrapolating
  from childhood and adolescence, for example, the University of York’s
  LifeSim (Skarda et al., 2021).</p>
      <p>I therefore decided to create microsimulation with a public-facing
  user interface – the Public Policy Preference Calculator (TriplePC) –
  that would enable automated assessment of economic and health impacts
  as well as public preferences between different welfare and tax
  policies. The TriplePC model project therefore had three strands:</p>

        <list-item>
          <p>Estimating the likely electoral popularity of possible policies

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>), with the data available as
  (Johnson et al., 2023). The authors of that study recruited 800 UK
  resident adults through the Prolific online platform. Participants
  were asked repeatedly to choose their preferred welfare policy from
  sets of two. Each time, the two policies contained the same input
  (design) and outcome (health and distributional) attributes but with
  randomised levels in each (e.g. payment sizes of £63 per child, £145
  per adult and £190 per pensioner; poverty decreased by 25% etc.). Each
  participant completed 15 choice tasks. Each option within each task
  was defined by 10 attributes. Each attribute had three to nine
  possible levels. Table 1 shows the full list of 10 attributes with
  between three and nine levels each.</p>
      <p>!! table 1 xxx</p>
      <p>Relative to the UK population, the sample contained an
  over-representation of people who voted for the left to centre-left
  Labour party at the 2019 general election (44.3% of those in our
  sample who voted, vs. 32.1% election result); and an
  under-representation of those who voted for the right to centre-right
  Conservative party (31.8% versus 43.6% election result). Although we
  did create survey weights to correct for this, TriplePC currently uses
  unweighted data.</p>
      <p>All options were fully randomly generated from the possible
  combinations. Instructions in the survey explained that participants
  might prefer some features in one policy and some in the other, but
  they needed to consider which policy they preferred overall. The
  attributes on which the policies varied were explained in greater
  depth prior to the first choice task, and then described just with
  brief phrases during the choice tasks themselves. Note that many of
  these randomly generated pairs are totally implausible. This is
  integral to how a fully randomized conjoint analysis works: by
  generating all the possible combinations, things that are actually
  correlated in real life (e.g. tax rates and poverty rates) are
  rendered orthogonal to one another. It is this that allows
  identification of their independent marginal effects.</p>
      <p>We simultaneously estimated the average impact of preference or
  dis-preference for particular feature attribute-value on preference
  for policies overall using comparable scales through computation of
  Average Marginal Component Effects
  (AMCEs)(<xref alt="Hainmueller, Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2013" rid="ref-hainmueller_causal_2013" ref-type="bibr">Hainmueller,
  Hopkins and Yamamoto, 2013</xref>) from linear probability models. The
  AMCE for a given level of an attribute can be interpreted as the
  marginal effect on the probability of choice of the attribute being at
  that level compared to the reference level, averaging across the
  possible levels of all other attributes. Through randomization and a
  high number of pairwise comparisons, this allows us to quantify the
  causal effect of including specific levels of individual reform
  elements on the support for the entire reform package, compared with
  the support for a reform package that contains the baseline level
  (status quo) of this particular reform element (Nettle et al., 2023a).

  In the conjoint methodology, these are assumed to have an additive
  effect on popularity. That is, for example, the popularity of a policy
  combining high income taxes, carbon tax, and a decrease in poverty
  will be the sum of the negative marginal effect on popularity of the
  high income tax, the positive marginal effect on popularity of the
  carbon tax, the positive marginal effect of the poverty reduction, and
  so on. This summation is the popularity outcome returned by the
  model.</p>
      <p>The conjoint analysis was conducted ahead of the construction of
  the microsimulation model. As we discuss below, some of the measures
  in Table 1 (income tax, payment sizes, poverty and inequality rates)
  are reasonably straightforward to model (though there are issues
  around definitions). Others, such as the ‘other funding’ options and
  the relationship between income and health, are harder.</p>

        <p>In conjoint surveys, respondents have preferences over inputs
    (income tax rates, payment sizes, etc.) and outcomes (poverty and
    inequality levels, numbers of mental health cases, etc.). We use
    microsimulation to bridge between them</p>
        <p>The analysis uses a heavily adapted version of Scotben (Stark
    2023a), an open-source microsimulation model of Scotland written in
    the Julia programming language. Scotben is a conventionally
    structured static tax-benefit model, in the family of models
    branching out from the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ TAXBEN. For
    this project, we extended the scope of the model to Great Britain2
    using a single 2021/22 wave of Family Resources Survey (FRS) data
    (<xref alt="DWP, 2012" rid="ref-dwp_family_2012" ref-type="bibr">DWP,
    2012</xref>). The model covers the whole of the UK personal tax and
    benefit system, including local taxes, with some minor exceptions
    such as Scottish Best Starts grants. As a base, we use the tax and
    benefit system as of Q3 2023, and all incomes, wealth and
    consumption are also uprated to 2023 Q3. We use the 2021/22 FRS
    sample weights as-is.</p>
        <p>The outcome questions are phrased as changes (e.g. ‘50% fewer
    cases of anxiety and depression’, ‘Poverty increased by 50%’). A
    particularly tricky question arising from this is how to establish a
    baseline for comparison. The conjoint experiment survey had no ‘keep
    things as they are’ option for the tax and benefit inputs, so there
    were two options for the TriplePC:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>Using a tax-benefit system some way from the current one as
        baseline and assuming that the outcome changes represent changes
        in poverty, health, etc. from that point, rather than changes
        from the actual current situation.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Using the current system as the baseline, but then the
        default output will have significant deviations for the outcome
        variables.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>Neither of these choices is good but on balance we decided 1) was
    the least bad. I It makes the conjoint popularity output much easier
    to understand: with option 2) we would be applying large changes in
    poverty and inequality to the base conjoint results which would make
    those results very unintuitive. The result, however, is that the
    model starts some distance from the actual existing system. This is
    certainly a lesson for future work.</p>

    first of these options is the current non-Scottish UK income tax
    rates, which we take as the base.3 All other options represent rate
    increases. We assume the corresponding thresholds are as present.
    Since we have to remain consistent with the conjoint analysis, only
    the six rate groups in Table 1 are presented to the user, though the
    model can handle any combination of rates and thresholds. We assume
    no behavioural responses to changing tax rates and make no

        <p>The payment size question in the conjoint survey was about a

    (<xref alt="Reed et al., 2023" rid="ref-reed_universal_2023b" ref-type="bibr">Reed
    <italic>et al.</italic>, 2023</xref>). There were also questions
    about eligibility, means-testing and citizenship (see Table 1,
    above). It is not clear how this proposed system of cash transfers
    should interact with the existing tax and benefit system, especially
    bearing in mind that the question is not how an expert believes they
    should interact, but what was most likely in the mind of the
    conjoint respondents. We follow our recent analysis (Reed et al.,
    2023b) and assume:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>means-tested benefits are retained.4</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>most other benefits, including the State Pension and Child
        Benefit, are abolished and replaced by the cash transfers.</p>

        </list>
        <p>The least generous set of options (Child - £0; Adult - £63;
    Pensioner - £190) are taken as the base values. Compared to the
    actual system, this means that we’re starting from a social security
    system that’s considerably more expensive (because of the adult
    payments), but where pensioners are usually slightly worse off (£190
    vs £203.85 for the new State Pension) and families with large
    numbers of children not on means-tested benefits are worse off,
    since the cash transfer to children is zero in the default case and
    the payments to adults are not always enough to compensate. We do
    not adjust taxes to meet these extra base costs. For eligibility,
    means-testing and citizenship options, it seemed plausible that at
    least some of the respondents might be aware of the means and
    eligibility tests from existing benefits. Consequently, we model the
    eligibility rules that apply to the ‘legacy’ UK benefits: Working
    Tax Credit and Income Support/Employment Support that are in the
    process of being phased out, and the means-tests are taken from the
    new Universal Credit (Child Poverty Action Group, 2022).</p>

            <list-item>
              <p>Our primary FRS dataset has limited information on wealth,
          mainly intended to help model benefit eligibility tests.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>The form this wealth tax should take is not specified.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Wealth taxes are held to be particularly easy to evade or
          avoid (Scheuer &amp; Slemrod, 2021).</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>To solve 1., we impute data from the Wealth and Assets Survey
      (WAS)
      (<xref alt="National Statistics, 2019b" rid="ref-ons-was-19a" ref-type="bibr">National
      Statistics, 2019b</xref>) onto the FRS households. We chose to do
      this using a simple linear regression of three categories of
      wealth (pensions, housing, and financial and other assets) against
      household characteristics that are common to FRS and WAS. In
      retrospect, regression-based imputation was likely a mistake and
      matching will be used in future versions.</p>
          <p>For the form of the tax, we were guided by the Wealth Tax
      Commission
      (<xref alt="Advani, Chamberlain and Summers, 2020" rid="ref-advani_wealth_2020" ref-type="bibr">Advani,
      Chamberlain and Summers, 2020</xref>). We followed their
      recommendations of excluding pension wealth, having an allowance
      of £500,000, and having the tax payable over five years, though we
      deviated from the Commission in applying the tax to aggregate
      household wealth rather than individual wealth
      (<xref alt="Chamberlain, 2020" rid="ref-chamberlain_defining_2020" ref-type="bibr">Chamberlain,
      2020</xref>).</p>
          <p>Even when payable over five years, as recommended by the Wealth
      Tax Commission, the payments from wealth taxes needed to fund some
      of the more generous benefit schemes can exceed net income for
      many families, especially elderly families who have high housing
      wealth. Most likely the scheme would need to be augmented by an
      income-related rebate scheme, or some scheme to defer until
      death.</p>

        <sec id="corporation-tax-increases">
          <title>‘Corporation tax increases’</title>
          <p>Building a plausible micro-data based model of Corporation Tax
      is difficult and not something that could be contemplated for this
      project. In any case, for a household-based microsimulation model,
      what matters is the incidence of the tax on the households. This
      could be on profits, or passed on in price increases or real wage
      reductions
      (<xref alt="Harberger, 1962" rid="ref-harberger_incidence_1962" ref-type="bibr">Harberger,
      1962</xref>;
      <xref alt="Atkinson and Stiglitz, 2015" rid="ref-atkinson_lectures_2015" ref-type="bibr">Atkinson
      and Stiglitz, 2015</xref>). If we make a simple ‘small country’
      assumption – that the rate of return on capital and the price of
      tradeable goods are set exogenously on world markets – then
      Corporation Tax is ultimately incident on (private sector) wages
      and self-employment income. Therefore, we calculate the tax
      increase needed to meet the costs of the benefit increase and
      reduce the wage bill by that amount. Note that as the wage bill
      falls, direct tax revenues also fall, but in a non-linear way
      because of the tax allowance and progressive tax rate structures,
      so finding the correct Corporation Tax increase requires the use
      of our root-finder. In practice the rates needed for the more
      generous benefit increases can be implausibly large, exceeding in
      some cases total UK Corporation’s Gross Profits.</p>

        <title>Model flow</title>
        <p>Putting all this together, a model run has five main stages:</p>
        <list list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>The user selects from the Payment size, Income tax, Other
        funding, Conditionality, Means testing, Universality options
        from Table 1.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The model then calculates net incomes for each person in the
        FRS households given these choices.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>These net incomes are in turn plugged in to the equations
        discussed in Section 2 to give us estimates of changes to the
        prevalence of depressive disorders and mortality.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The model next calculates gainers and losers, revenues and
        costs, and changes in poverty and inequality.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Finally, the model calculates conjoint public preferences
        based on 1 to 4 above and displays the results.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>The model has a simple single page web interface, publicly
    available at https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk/. Figure 1, below,
    shows this in action. The user has selected a relatively generous
    benefit increase (top left panel), partially paid for by income tax
    increases (top centre). The bottom half of the screen shows the
    results, relative to the base discussed in section 3 above. Health
    results are in the bottom row, showing small mental health
    improvements. The net cost of this scheme is £118bn (right middle
    panel). Poverty and inequality are both reduced (centre left panel).
    The Conjoint analysis is in the centre: the scheme is more popular
    by 4.7 points than the baseline due to the popularity of the poverty
    and inequality reductions and the benefit increases, though this is
    partly offset by unpopular tax increases.</p>

        <title>Reflections on the approach</title>
        <p>One important lesson for similar future work is the need for good
    coordination between conjoint analysis and microsimulation modelling
    at the outset of the project.</p>
        <p>In our case, the conjoint analysis was conducted ahead of
    microsimulation modelling work. Consequently, microsimulation
    requirements were largely fixed by the questions in the conjoint
    survey. This has several consequences:</p>
        <list list-type="bullet">
          <list-item>
            <p>The model could present only a very limited set of options
        for taxes and benefits compared to the model’s underlying
        capabilities. The survey system used for the survey – Qualtrics
        – had a hard limit on the number of attributes that could be
        included, which meant that it was not possible to ask about
        basic and higher tax rates individually. It might also have
        increased respondent load to an unacceptable level and therefore
        reduced the quality of the preference data.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>The meaning of options such as ‘Tax on wealth’ should, where
        possible, be made clearer in order to provide a clear direction
        for modelling.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Co-development of a conjoint survey and microsimulation might
        have enabled respondents to see accurate consequences of their
        preferred policies for incomes and health.
        </p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Some of the options in the survey, such as VAT increases,
        were quite burdensome to model in the time available.
        </p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Careful thought must be given to the definition of the base
        case the model is comparing against.</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>
        <p>There are also interesting questions about how best to present
    results of a model with such diverse outputs. For instance, since
    one is a stock and the other a flow, can we count payments by a
    household from a wealth tax in the same way as payments for income
    tax? And should we be imputing a monetary value to any health
    improvements?</p>
        <p>I have presented the TriplePC, a new microsimulation model with
    novel but important features. We have established the importance and
    practicality of using conjoint data to provide instant analysis of
    the political implications of welfare packages, but also learned
    some important lessons on how best to conduct integrated
    microsimulation and conjoint analysis. We have also estimated new
    measures of the relationship between income and health and shown how
    these, too, can be integrated into the model. The TriplePC is
    available online at https://triplepc.northumbria.ac.uk/ and its
    source code, linked on the main site, is released under an
    open-source licence.</p>
